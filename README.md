Launches with Start.py
This is just something I had AI construct.
Started with a simple Python dice simulator
Added the craps game
Added a betting element to the craps game
After that I attempted to turn it into a React app, but my instrucitons were out of date and I ran into issues getting WSL to work.
I ended up trying VITE and I could get an app started, but it wasn't working for me somehow, I forget how.
I asked AI to figure out a better way and that led us to FLASK.
